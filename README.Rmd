## Installation

You can install the development version of bricolR like so:

[Under Construction]
Func' to compute some typical need you'll have when renovating your house. Organized under several "areas" of interest (e.g., insulation solution performance and costs, assuming the user providing a surface to cover)

Basically, most of the func' offering the possibility (a) to indicate the caracteristics of the environment and (b) tweak the norms and models parameters, if desired.

For example, if you want to compute some stairs implementation, you'll need to take under consideration (a) the caracteristics of the environment (e.g., the stairwell frame [*"trÃ©mie"*] and then the (b) stair-norms let you compute your possibilities of stairs design' and implementation.



``` r
# A REMPLIR => HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bricolR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
